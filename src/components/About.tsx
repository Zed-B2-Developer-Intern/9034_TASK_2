            Hey there! I'm <span className="font-semibold">Ganesan P</span>, a curious and motivated web developer based in Tamil Nadu, India. I love building intuitive and accessible web applications, and I thrive in environments that encourage creativity, innovation, and collaboration.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Over the years, I've built a strong foundation in languages like <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and have hands-on experience with tools and frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, and <strong>Flutter</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            My portfolio includes everything from cryptography-based CTF challenges to sustainable tech like <strong>GreenWay Navigator</strong>—an AI-powered tool promoting eco-friendly travel. I'm particularly passionate about solving real-world problems through thoughtful design and clean code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond development, I enjoy taking online courses, gardening, and exploring new technologies. I’m always looking to grow, contribute to open source, and build meaningful digital experiences that make a difference.
